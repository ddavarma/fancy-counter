# Fancy Counter - React + Bun

This is a **basic counter application** built with **React** and powered by **Bun** for package management and development.  
The project helped me gain practical experience with **React fundamentals**, **state management**, **component composition**, and **rendering patterns**.

## ðŸ›  What I Learned

While building this project, I explored and implemented the following key concepts:

- **React Fundamentals**:
  - Understanding JSX syntax and where to use `{}` for logic.
  - Writing component-based UI with functional components.
- **State Management**:
  - Using `useState` to handle state updates for increment, decrement, and reset functionalities.
  - Implementing `useEffect` for side effects where necessary.
- **Prop Drilling vs. Prop Composition**:
  - Passing props efficiently across components.
  - Learning about alternatives to deeply nested prop drilling.
- **Rendering Patterns**:
  - Understanding how React re-renders components.
  - Exploring component updates and reconciliation.
- **Basic CSS Styling**:
  - Adding styles for UI enhancements.
  - Improving button responsiveness and layout structure.
- **Using Bun for Development**:
  - Installing dependencies with `bun install`.
  - Running the project with `bun rev dev` for fast development.
